# Workflow Analysis  

## 1. What is the purpose of creating branches?  
Creating branches allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. This keeps the project stable while changes are being developed.  

## 2. Why are pull requests important?  
Pull requests are important because they allow team members to review changes before merging.  
They help catch mistakes, suggest improvements, and ensure the code meets project standards.  

## 3. What is the role of GitHub Actions?  
GitHub Actions automate tasks such as testing, building, and deployment.  
This saves time and ensures consistency in the workflow.  

## 4. Why is code review critical in a team project?  
Code review improves quality by catching bugs early, sharing knowledge across the team, and keeping the code style consistent.  

## 5. How does merging happen in GitHub?  
Merging happens after a pull request is approved.  
The feature branch is combined into the main branch, bringing in the new changes.  

## 6. What did you learn from this workflow?  
I learned how to create branches, open pull requests, and merge them into the main branch.  
I also learned how collaboration tools like GitHub Actions and reviews help maintain quality in team projects.
