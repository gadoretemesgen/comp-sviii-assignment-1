# Workflow Analysis

## Question 1: What is the purpose of using branches in GitHub?
Branches allow developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation from the main codebase. 
This helps teams collaborate without disrupting the production-ready version of the code.

## Question 2: Why are pull requests important in a workflow?
Pull requests let team members review code before merging it into the main branch. 
They ensure quality, provide opportunities for feedback, and prevent bugs or issues from being introduced.

## Question 3: How do GitHub Actions support automation?
GitHub Actions automate repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and code formatting. 
They help maintain consistency, catch errors early, and save developer time.

## Question 4: What did you learn from creating and merging pull requests?
I learned how to create branches, make commits, and open pull requests for review. 
I also learned how to collaborate by reviewing and commenting on code. 
This process reflects how professional teams manage codebases in the real world.

## Reflection
This workflow taught me how to use GitHub effectively in a team environment. 
By practicing branching, pull requests, and reviews, I understand how professional developers 
maintain high-quality code and collaborate more efficiently.
